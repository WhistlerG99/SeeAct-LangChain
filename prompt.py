    No Value Operations:

    - SCROLL DOWN: Scroll the webpage downwards by half of the window height.
    - PRESS HOME: Scroll to the top of the webpage.
    - PRESS END: Scroll to the bottom of the webpage.
    - PRESS PAGEUP: Scroll up by one window height.
    - PRESS PAGEDOWN: Scroll down by one window height.
    - CLOSE TAB: Close the current tab in the browser.
    - NEW TAB: Open a new tab in the browser.
    - GO BACK: Navigate to the previous page in the browser history.
    - GO FORWARD: Navigate to the next page in the browser history.
    - TERMINATE: End the current task, typically used when the task is considered complete or requires potentially harmful actions.
    - NONE: Indicates that no action is necessary at this stage. Used to skip an action or wait.

    With Value Operations:
    - SELECT: Choose an option from a dropdown menu or <select> element. The value indicates the option to select.
    - TYPE: Enter text into a text area or text box. The value is the text to be typed.

Clearly outline which element in the webpage users will operate with as the first next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

    To be successful, it is important to follow the following rules: 
    1. You should only issue a valid action given the current observation. 
    2. You should only issue one action at a time
    3. For handling the select dropdown elements on the webpage, it's not necessary for you to provide completely accurate options right now. The full list of options for these elements will be supplied later.
    4. Unlike humans, for typing (e.g., in text areas, text boxes) and selecting (e.g., from dropdown menus or <select> elements), you should try directly typing the input or selecting the choice, bypassing the need for an initial click. 
    5. You should not attempt to create accounts, log in or do the final submission. 
    6. Terminate when you deem the task complete or if it requires potentially harmful actions.
    7. Do not generate same action as the previous one, try different ways if keep failing
    8. When there is a floating banner like ads, login, or survey floating taking more than 30% of the page, close the floating banner to proceed, the close button could look like a x on the right top corner, or choose NO THANKS to close it.
    9. When there is a floating banner on top or bottom of the page like cookie policy taking less than 30% of the page, ignore the banner to proceed.  
    10. After typing text into search or text input area, the next action is normally PRESS ENTER
    11. When there are bouding boxes in the screenshot, interact with the elements in the bounding boxes
    12. When there are multiple clickable buttons having the same value, choose the one with less obstacles in the screenshot.

    First, reiterate your next target element, its detailed location, and the corresponding operation.

    (Multichoice Question)
    Below is a multi-choice question, where the choices are elements in the webpage. All elements are arranged in the order based on their height on the webpage, from top to bottom (and from left to right). This arrangement in addition to the normalized coordinates can be used to locate them. From the screenshot, find out where and what each one is on the webpage, taking into account both their text content and HTML details. Then, determine whether one matches your target element if your action involves an element. Please examine the choices one by one. Choose the matching one. If multiple options match your answer, choose the most likely one by re-examining the screenshot, the choices, and your further reasoning.""",
